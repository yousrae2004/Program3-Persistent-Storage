# Program 3: Save and Load Implementation

## For my implementation of the save and load mechanic, I had the player move a square using the arrow keys and save their position by pressing 'S'. Then, when you press play again and use the 'L' key, it will load your player back in the same position you saved. 

## 3 Storage Mechanisms
1. Unity PLayerPrefs
Using the input key-value pair storage built into the Unity engine.
**Pros** Simple to implement since Unity already has this feature included.
**Cons** Not practical to use for larger and more in-depth games that require more complicated mechanisms.
I chose to use it because its simple and easy to use, especially for a simple task like storing
the player's last saved position.

2. JSON Serialization
Saving data using a JSON file
**Pros** Simple and easy to use and read, and can store complex data.
**Cons** Needs its own setup for file reading, and since it is easily readable, this makes it a security issue.
I mainly didn't use it since I haven't before, and it would take some time to get used to, especially with how it was mentioned that many people encountered errors during the lecture while using JSON.

3. Custom Save File
**Pros** More flexibility in choosing how to save and load your data
**Cons** Can be time-consuming and complex to set up
I didn't use this method because of the time commitment and learning curve needed.
